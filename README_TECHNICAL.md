# CaRaFagio - Compression and Reference Format for Automated Generative Imagery Oracle

## What is CaRaFagio?

CaRaFagio is an ultra-compressed symbolic language designed for efficient communication between AI systems about generative art. It encodes complex artistic, technical, and aesthetic concepts into single characters, enabling AI models to share rich creative information in minimal tokens.

Originally created to maximize information density in limited conversation windows, CaRaFagio evolved into a complete generative art language that bridges technical parameters with artistic knowledge.

## Key Features

### üé® Artistic Knowledge Compression
- **83 unique symbols** encoding hundreds of concepts
- Complete art history from Classical to Contemporary
- 15 master artists from Leonardo to Banksy
- 12 artistic movements from Impressionism to Digital Art
- 8 cultural traditions (Ukiyo-e, Islamic, Aboriginal, etc.)
- Photography, color theory, composition, and lighting systems

### üîß Technical Integration
- Support for all major AI architectures (SD1.5, SDXL, SD3.5, FLUX, etc.)
- LoRA/adaptation systems with full parameter ranges
- Advanced prompt engineering with model-aware syntax
- Hardware optimization profiles
- Complete sampler and scheduler mappings

### üöÄ Advanced Features
- **Prompt Engine**: Automatically translates CaRaFagio chains into model-specific syntax
- **Macro System**: Pre-defined style combinations for quick access
- **Model-Aware Generation**: Adapts output for each model's quirks (score_9 for Pony, natural language for FLUX, etc.)
- **Workflow Chains**: Complex operations compressed into simple symbols

## Quick Examples

### Basic Symbol Usage
```
Œ©1 = Rule of thirds composition
Œõ2 = Chiaroscuro lighting  
Œó4 = Caravaggio style
```

### Creating a Prompt
```
Input: Œ±1+Œ©1+Œõ2+Œó4
Output: "(dramatic portrait:1.2), chiaroscuro lighting, caravaggio style, masterpiece"
```

### Using Macros
```
MACRO:VANGOGH_STYLE ‚Üí Œ©4+Œò3+Œñ2+Œù2+Œ®3+Œï3+Œó8
Translation: Curved composition + triadic colors + impasto + broken brushwork + expressionism + passionate emotion + Van Gogh
```

## File Structure

- `carafagio_v2_ultra.md` - Ultra-compressed reference (95% compression, AI-readable)
- `crf_p2_legend.md` - Human-readable symbol legend
- `README.md` - This file
- `LICENSE.md` - License information
- `examples/` - Example usage and translations
- `tools/` - Helper scripts for translation

## Usage

### For AI Systems
1. Load the carafagio reference file
2. Parse symbol chains using the defined grammar
3. Apply model-specific syntax using the prompt engine
4. Generate appropriate outputs

### For Humans
1. Consult the legend file for symbol meanings
2. Combine symbols to create artistic directions
3. Use the prompt engine to translate to natural language
4. Apply to your preferred AI model
