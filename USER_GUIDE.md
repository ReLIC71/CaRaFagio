# CaRaFagio User Guide - The Practical Version

## What You Actually Need to Know

CaRaFagio is a hyper-compressed language for AI art generation. **You don't need to learn it.** Claude (or other AI assistants) will translate for you.

## How to Use CaRaFagio

### The Simple Way

1. **Tell Claude what you want in plain English**
   ```
   "I want a portrait in Rembrandt's style with dramatic lighting"
   ```

2. **Claude translates to CaRaFagio**
   ```
   Ω1+Λ1+Θ7+Ζ3+Ν1+Ε2+Η5
   ```

3. **Claude generates the appropriate prompt for your model**
   - For SD1.5: "(portrait:1.2), rembrandt lighting, chiaroscuro, masterpiece"
   - For FLUX: "A melancholic portrait in Rembrandt's style with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting"
   - For Pony: "score_9, score_8_up, portrait, rembrandt_style, chiaroscuro"

### What Claude Can Do For You

- **Style Mixing**: "Combine Van Gogh's brushwork with cyberpunk aesthetics"
- **Technical Precision**: "Set up a three-point perspective with rim lighting"
- **Model Optimization**: "Make this work well on FLUX" or "Optimize for fast generation"
- **Complex Workflows**: "Create a regional prompt with different styles in each area"

### Example Conversations

**You**: "Create a moody landscape with impressionist techniques"
**Claude**: I'll use CaRaFagio to create that: Ω2+Λ6+Θ2+Ζ4+Ψ1+Ε2
This translates to a golden ratio composition with ambient lighting, analogous colors, scumbling technique, impressionist style, and melancholic mood.

**You**: "Make it work on Stable Diffusion XL"
**Claude**: For SDXL, this becomes: "impressionist landscape, soft ambient lighting, harmonious colors, textured brushstrokes, melancholic atmosphere, golden ratio composition"
